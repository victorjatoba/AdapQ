 * Note that R has several types of percentile computation in the quantile() function.
 * The Percentile class in Apache Commons Math is teh same as type=6 in the R quantile function.
 * Use the folling function to compute Scott's rule in R. This is teh same as bw.nrd() but with
 * a quantile function that uses type=6.

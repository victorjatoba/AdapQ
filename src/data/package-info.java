 * Model Managed-Bean: Normally session scope. This type of managed-bean
 * participates in the "Model" concern of the MVC design pattern. When
 * you see the word "model" -- think DATA. A JSF model-bean should be a
 * POJO that follows the JavaBean design pattern with getters/setters
 * encapsulating properties. The most common use case for a model bean
 * is to be a database entity, or to simply represent a set of rows from
 * the result set of a database query.
